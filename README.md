# Scraping Images of a Yearbook with Selenium

The task involved scraping a list of image URLs and downloading the corresponding images from classmates.com. To accomplish this, I employed two main steps: automating the Chrome browser using `Selenium` with `undetected_chromedriver` and accessing image urls with `urllib.request`.

The yearbook is available at the following link: [Yearbook](https://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Alameda-High-School/4182755124?page=7).

`scrape.ipynb` contains the code for scraping the image URLs and downloading the corresponding images. The code is well-documented and easy to understand.
